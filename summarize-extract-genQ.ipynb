        "Raw materials: Raw materials are often natural resources such as crude oil, iron ore and wood. They are harvested from the earth. Processed materials are materials refined by humans.eg steel, petrol, paper, glass Iron ore: Iron ore is available on earth in the form of rocks rich in iron oxide. It also contains other impurities such as Sulphur. Iron is extracted from iron ore by heating them (above 1250 deg C) with coke (Coke is a refined form of coal) in a furnace called blast furnace. Oxides and other impurities are removed from the iron ore to leave the iron behind which is called ‘Pig iron’.\n",
        "Pig iron ingots Pig iron contains higher percentage of carbon (3.5 to 4.5%). Therefore, it is very hard and brittle and it cannot be used as an engineering material. To become steel, it must be melted again and reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount. Steel is iron and up to 1.5% carbon. Elements such as chromium, nickel, tungsten, vanadium can also be added to steel, to get different properties. When added, they are called alloy steels. After preparation of the correct material, the liquid steel is allowed to solidify in the form of a billet, slab or an ingot. These are again processed to make final products.eg.

        "Plain carbon steel: Carbon steel is the most widely used kind of steel. The properties of carbon steel depend primarily on the amount of carbon it contains. There are three types of plain carbon steels. (a) Mild steel (up to 0.3% C) (b) Medium carbon steel (0.3 to 0.8%) (c) High carbon steel (0.8 to 1.5%) The following graph shows the variation of (i) strength (toughness), (ii) ductility and malleability, (iii) hardness & brittleness with increase in carbon percentage.\n",
        "Cast iron\n",
        "Cast iron is made by melting pig iron with cast iron scrap and steel scrap in cupola furnaces and poured into molds to make castings. Cast Iron is generally defined as an alloy of iron with 2.5 % to 3 5 % Carbon, and usually with small amount of Silicon and Manganese. Due to its high carbon percentage that exists in the form of graphite, it has self lubricating property.\n",
        "Cast iron is comparatively weak and brittle in tension and has a high hardness. It can take high compression loads. It has lubricating properties and easily cast. (casting is a manufacturing process)\n",
        "Cast iron is used to make automotive parts such as engine blocks, cylinder liners, cylinder heads, machine parts, industrial components, pump housings and motor housings. Applications of mild steel, medium carbon steel, high carbon steel and cast iron are given below.\n",
        "Alloy steels: Steel has Iron and Carbon. Alloy steel has one or more alloying elements other than iron and carbon such as chromium, vanadium, nickel, tungsten etc. The basic properties of steel given above in this chapter can be changed by adding various alloying elements. Applications of alloy steels:- (a) Stainless steel: - Good quality stainless steel has about 18 to 20% Chromium as the alloying element. Stainless steel does not readily corrode, rust or stain with water as ordinary steel does. It has the ability to resist oxidation.\n",

        "High Speed Steel contains about 18% Tungsten as the alloying element. It performs a high hardness and a high wear resistance. Therefore, this material is used to make cutting tools (tools to cut other materials of less hardness).\n",

        "Non-ferrous metals do not contain iron (Fe) in appreciable amounts. They are more expensive than ferrous metals. They have exceptional engineering properties.\n",
        "Example of some non ferrous metals used in the industry: • Aluminum has low weight and resistance to corrosion. • Copper has high electrical and thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion. Electrical wires (conductors) are made of copper • Lead is a good conductor of electricity. Lead and Tin are mixed 1 : 1 ratio to make solder. • Tin is applied on ferrous metals (inside cans) to prevent corrosion • Zinc has high ability to resist corrosion. Melted zinc is applied on ferrous metals to prevent corrosion. The process is called galvanizing.\n",
        "Non ferrous alloys:-\n",
        "(a) Aluminum that is used in the industry is not pure aluminum, but they are alloys. Alloying elements are copper, silicon, tin, zinc etc. Their applications are automobile bodies, aircrafts, cans, alloy wheels, tubes and sections and sheets.\n",
