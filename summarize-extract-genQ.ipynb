The manufacturing process begins with the use of the materials and then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part. The process involves use of machinery, tools, power and labour. During the process, it adds greater valve to the final product. Therefore, manufacturing is a value added process.\n",
        "Machinery Tools Power Labour\n",
        "Raw materials Product\n",
        "Raw materials: Raw materials are often natural resources such as crude oil, iron ore and wood. They are harvested from the earth. Processed materials are materials refined by humans.eg steel, petrol, paper, glass Iron ore: Iron ore is available on earth in the form of rocks rich in iron oxide. It also contains other impurities such as Sulphur. Iron is extracted from iron ore by heating them (above 1250 deg C) with coke (Coke is a refined form of coal) in a furnace called blast furnace. Oxides and other impurities are removed from the iron ore to leave the iron behind which is called ‘Pig iron’.\n",
        "Pig iron ingots Pig iron contains higher percentage of carbon (3.5 to 4.5%). Therefore, it is very hard and brittle and it cannot be used as an engineering material. To become steel, it must be melted again and reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount. Steel is iron and up to 1.5% carbon. Elements such as chromium, nickel, tungsten, vanadium can also be added to steel, to get different properties. When added, they are called alloy steels. After preparation of the correct material, the liquid steel is allowed to solidify in the form of a billet, slab or an ingot. These are again processed to make final products.eg. Sheets, tubes, rods This includes production of iron, copper, aluminum and other metals from their ores.\n",
        "The basic properties of materials\n",
        "1. Physical properties:\n",
        "These can be considered to include density, specific gravity and melting point.\n",
        "2. Electrical properties:\n",
        "Electrical properties are resistivity and conductivity.\n",
        "3. Thermal properties:\n",
        "These are displayed when there is heat input to a material and include expansion, thermal conductivity and specific heat.\n",
        "4. Chemical properties:\n",
        "These are, for example, corrosion\n",
        "5. Mechanical properties:\n",
        "The mechanical properties of materials defined the behavior of materials under the action of external forces called loads or stresses. There is a measure of strength and durability of a material in service. These properties are great importance in the design of machines and structures.\n",
        "The most important mechanical properties\n",
        "1. Strength\n",
        "The strength of material is its capacity to withstand failure under the action of external\n",
        "loads. The stronger the material the greater the load it can withstand before failure.\n",
        "Types of Stresses: -\n",
        "(i). Tensile Stress: the force acts to pull materials apart\n",
        "(ii). Compressive Stress: the force squeezes material\n",
        "(iii). Shear Stress: the force causes one part to slide on another part\n",
        "2. Elasticity\n",
        "The elasticity of a metal is its power of coming back to its original shape after deformation when the loads are removed.\n",
        "3. Plasticity\n",
        "The plasticity of a metal is the ability to change its shape without destruction under the application of loads, and to retain its shape, when the loads are withdrawn.\n",
        "4. Toughness\n",
        "This ability of a material to resist hammering or impact loads without fracturing. Toughness is a high desirable quality for structural and machine parts which have to withstand shocks and vibrations.\n",
        "5. Brittleness\n",
        "The brittleness of material is the property of braking without much permanent distortion. These materials break into pieces due to impact.\n",

        "7. Ductility\n",

There are three types of plain carbon steels. (a) Mild steel (up to 0.3% C) (b) Medium carbon steel (0.3 to 0.8%) (c) High carbon steel (0.8 to 1.5%) The following graph shows the variation of (i) strength (toughness), (ii) ductility and malleability, (iii) hardness & brittleness with increase in carbon percentage.\n",
        "Cast iron\n",
        "Cast iron is made by melting pig iron with cast iron scrap and steel scrap in cupola furnaces and poured into molds to make castings. Cast Iron is generally defined as an alloy of iron with 2.5 % to 3 5 % Carbon, and usually with small amount of Silicon and Manganese. Due to its high carbon percentage that exists in the form of graphite, it has self lubricating property.\n",
        "Cast iron is comparatively weak and brittle in tension and has a high hardness. It can take high compression loads. It has lubricating properties and easily cast. (casting is a manufacturing process)\n",
        "Cast iron is used to make automotive parts such as engine blocks, cylinder liners, cylinder heads, machine parts, industrial components, pump housings and motor housings. Applications of mild steel, medium carbon steel, high carbon steel and cast iron are given below.\n",
        "Alloy steels: Steel has Iron and Carbon. Alloy steel has one or more alloying elements other than iron and carbon such as chromium, vanadium, nickel, tungsten etc. The basic properties of steel given above in this chapter can be changed by adding various alloying elements. Applications of alloy steels:- (a) Stainless steel: - Good quality stainless steel has about 18 to 20% Chromium as the alloying element. Stainless steel does not readily corrode, rust or stain with water as ordinary steel does. It has the ability to resist oxidation.\n",

        "Non ferrous metals:-\n",
        "Non-ferrous metals do not contain iron (Fe) in appreciable amounts. They are more expensive than ferrous metals. They have exceptional engineering properties.\n",
        "Example of some non ferrous metals used in the industry: • Aluminum has low weight and resistance to corrosion. • Copper has high electrical and thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion. Electrical wires (conductors) are made of copper • Lead is a good conductor of electricity. Lead and Tin are mixed 1 : 1 ratio to make solder. • Tin is applied on ferrous metals (inside cans) to prevent corrosion • Zinc has high ability to resist corrosion. Melted zinc is applied on ferrous metals to prevent corrosion. The process is called galvanizing.\n",
        "Non ferrous alloys:-\n",
